# Membership & Map App

## 2016/03/03
## Synopsis

A simple app including:
* login screen
* user signup
* user manager 
* map screen plotting addresses of all users.

## View it live

## Motivation
This was an exercise in better organizing my MVC code in Angular.

## Installation
[https://github.com/wesgk/MembershipMap.git](https://github.com/wesgk/MembershipMap.git)
 npm install

## Resources
* [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro)

## Bugs and Future Changes
* The loading of Google Maps API isn't being handled correctly and therefore the maps don't always display.  If you experience this on heroku refresh the brower once or twice.  This fix underway.
* Checkboxes on User Map screen should filter map markers: not yet working.
